All objects in Js are linked to a Prototype


Prototype   (contains Method)
    ^
    |
    |
  Object    (Object Inherits Methods from Prototype &
              Object Delegates behaviour to the Prototype
              That's why the arrow is pointing upwards)

Above is called as Prototypal Inheritance


When we do

const num = [1,2,3];
num.map(v=> v*2);

Here the map method is defined inside
the Array.prototype.map()

Array.prototype is the prototype of all the array Objects that we create in JS
Hence all the arrays have access to the map method

so our num array inherited the map method


3 Ways of Applying OOPs in JS
1)Constructor Function
-Technique to create object using function
-This is how OOPS is implemented in JS

2)ES6  Classes

3)Object.create()
