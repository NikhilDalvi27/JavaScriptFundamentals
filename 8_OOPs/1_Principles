Class is a blueprint(eg Blue print of House)
using that blueprint(Class)
we create any number of actual Objects(Instance of Class)(eg Actual Houses)



4 pillars of OOPS

1)Abstraction
    Hide the Implementation details that don't matter
2)Encapsuation
    Keeping some properties and methods Private,
    so that they are not accessible outside the class
    and properties are accessible only through
    some methods public

3)Inheritance
    When two class are closely related we can have
    one class to inherit from the other..forming parent and child relation
    so as to avoid duplicate code...goal is to reuse the code from parent class
4)Polymorphism
    A child class can overwrite the method it inherited
    from the parent class
