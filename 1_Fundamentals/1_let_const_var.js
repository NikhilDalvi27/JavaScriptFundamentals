//todo let is block scoped
// and var is function scoped



// todo  let can be changed
//  or mutated
let age =30;
age =31;

//todo  const cannot be changed
const birthYear = 1990

//todo below will give error
// birthYear=1991;

//todo decalring with const needs a initial value
// below will give error
// const job;


//todo As a practice always use const
// use let only when you are definitely sure
// that the variable will change in future


//todo var should be as AVOIDED as possible
